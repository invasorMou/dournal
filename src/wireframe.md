to-do journal

I want an app to log my todos and some curious data that I want to look up later.

I think I could create a front end app that do all of this.

1. Create a to do
2. Remove a to do
3. Mark as done, which should remove them, or move them to a different section
4. I would like to store this in the browser
5. Would like to work offline
6. Would like to work as PWA, so I can 'isntall' in my phone.
